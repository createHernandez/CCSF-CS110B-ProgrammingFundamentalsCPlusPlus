Midterm 
Loops, I/O manipulation, and File I/O in C and C++

Description: 
The prompt for the midterm in CS110B at CCSF was to create a program that took 
user input for the range and converted Celsius temperatures into Fahrenheit 
temperatures in C and C++. There was a total of two functions writeToConsoleAndFileCStyle() 
and writeToConsoleAndFileCPlusPlusStyle(). writeToConsoleAndFileCStyle() performed 
the conversion and output the results to the console and a text file, "data.txt". 
writeToConsoleAndFileCPlusPlusStyle() also performed the conversion, but output the 
results to the console and a text file, "data1.txt".
